# Studio Art: Scale and Proportion in Art and Design 

Scale and proportion can show the size of one form in relation to another. For three-dimensional art, human scale has long been the measure that helps us understand our relationship to objects in the world. Artists can use that as a reference point to create works that surprise, alarm, delight, and intrigue the viewer.

Both Charles Ray and Ron Mueck create discomfort by upending our expectations of human scale with dramatically large or small human figures.

Claus Oldenburg makes us look at our environment differently with whimsical alterations of the scale of everyday objects, while Jeff Koons reintroduces familiar textures and forms of children's toys and mass-produced ephemera on a grand scale that defies our expectations. Earthworks, such as the Spiral Jetty by Robert Smithson, make us aware of the scale of the natural world in relation to man. The context of an earthwork like Spiral Jetty can be conveyed through photography at a distant view, but the individual's experience of the works in person will be quite different.Internal scale within an artwork can signal the importance of one element over others through a hierarchy of size. Hieratic scale has been employed throughout the history of art to convey the importance of a figure in a composition. On the facade of the Temple of Ramses II at Abu Simbel, colossal 65-foot tall statues of Ramses dwarf representations of family members. In painting, the Ognissanti Madonna by Giotto visually articulates the importance of the Virgin Mary through hieratic internal scale.Sometimes scale and proportion work hand in hand to present the viewer with more than one idea. In a manuscript of Makhzan al-asrar, the disproportional scale of the figures in relation to the architecture signal the importance of the figures as well as the need to display the entire building to the viewer. Additionally, the small size of this work (the page is just over 10 inches tall) and tremendous level of minute detail signal an intimacy for the viewer in exploring the work alone. In Jean Pucelle's Belleville Breviary, a similarly sized miniature, the same relationship of figures to architecture exists, and the added whimsy of elaborate marginalia invites close inspection.If illuminated miniatures remind us that the actual size of a work is important, it should also be noted that reproductions of works of art sometimes make a work appear monumental when it is actually quite small. For example, the so-called Venus of Willendorf is only 4.3 inches tall, but when projected on a screen, due to the simplicity of form, it appears massive. Thomas Struth's photographs of well-known works of art in museum settings address our usual experience of seeing of art in reproduction because he includes figures that reintroduce human scale as a reference point. Proportion is the relative scale of objects within a composition. As with scale, the human body can be a reference for proportional relationships, and has been for generations of artists. Leonardo da Vinci addressed the issue of ideal proportions discussed by Pliny the Elder a millennium earlier and articulated by the ancient Roman scholar Vitruvius in the 1st Century B.C.E. Go here for more on the Doryphoros by Polykleitos, an artwork at the center of that debate. Michelangelo's 13-foot-tall statue of David addresses proportional scale of part-to-part introduced in ancient times, and alters it by enlarging the head, brow, and the hands to accommodate the point of view from the ground to the roofline of the Florence Cathedral, the sculpture's originally intended location.Within an individual work of art, artists make decisions about scale to create feelings of expansiveness or immediacy. In his view of Santa Maria della Salute, Canaletto chose to emphasize the massive scale of the architecture in relation to people and boats, while Mary Cassatt's In the Loge places the viewer directly adjacent to the figure as if we are together surveying the Opera House.For more on Proportion and Perspective see a useful lesson idea from Steven Wills in this image group.See: Pentak, Stephen, Richard Roth, and David A.
